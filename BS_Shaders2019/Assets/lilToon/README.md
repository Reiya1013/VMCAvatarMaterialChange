# lilToon
Version 1.3.7

# Overview
This shader is developed for services using avatars (VRChat, etc.) and has the following features.
- Easy to use (One-click settings from presets, Saving your own presets, Color correction and exporting textures)
- Beautiful (Prevent overexposure, Anti-aliased shading)
- Lightweight (Automatically rewrites shaders and turns features on / off)
- Available in various versions (Unity 2018-2022, BRP/LWRP/URP/HDRP)
- Compatible with all lighting and similar in brightness to StandardShader

# Support
Supported Unity versions
- Unity 2018 - Unity 2022.2

Tested version
- Unity 2018.1.0f2 (Built-in RP)
- Unity 2018.4.20f1 (Built-in RP / LWRP 4.10.0 / HDRP 4.10.0)
- Unity 2019.2.21f1 (Built-in RP / LWRP 6.9.2 / HDRP 6.9.2)
- Unity 2019.3.0f6  (Built-in RP / URP 7.1.8 / HDRP 7.1.8)
- Unity 2019.4.31f1 (Built-in RP / URP 7.7.1 / HDRP 7.7.1)
- Unity 2020.3.36f1 (Built-in RP / URP 10.9.0 / HDRP 10.9.0)
- Unity 2021.3.16f1 (Built-in RP / URP 12.1.8 / HDRP 12.1.8)
- Unity 2022.2.1f1 (Built-in RP / URP 14.0.4 / HDRP 14.0.4)

I have confirmed that there is no error in `2021.3.16f1` and `2022.2.1f1`, but due to a problem on the Unity side, it may not be rendered correctly when using URP/HDRP. If you have any problems, please downgrade the version or update to the latest version as soon as it is fixed.

2. Select a material from Project.
3. Select `lilToon` from `Shader` at the top of Inspector.
4. If no texture has been applied, set the texture to `Main Color`.
5. To make the material transparent, change `Rendering Mode` to `Cutout` or `Transparent`.

# How to distribute your works that use lilToon
- If you want to include shaders, it is recommended to include a shortcut to the [BOOTH](https://booth.pm/ja/items/3087170) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lilxyzw/lilToon/releases) download page, or to include the shader unitypackage as a separate file.
- The method of combining shaders and creations into a single unitypackage has been deprecated. (due to problems such as overwriting with an older version during import)

# Common Problems
- Material error has occurred.  
  → Clicking `Assets/lilToon/Refresh Shaders` in the top menu bar may help.
- Editor error has occurred.  
  → Right-clicking the` lilToon` folder and `Reimport` may help.
- Cannot use alpha mask  
  → Please check the following
  - Set rendering mode to `Cutout` or `Transparent`
  - Assign a texture to `Alpha Mask` in the Main Color menu
- UI is not displayed when selecting a material / There is an error in the editor  
  → You may have a mix of older versions of lilToon. Delete the `lilToon` folder and then import unitypackage again.
- Different meshes have different lighting.  
  → Right click on your avatar and select `[lilToon] Fix Lighting` to automatically fix this.
- The shadows on face are dirty.  
  → You can specify a mask texture in `Mask & Strength` to partially remove shadows.
- Outline becomes dirty.  
  → You can specify a mask texture in `Mask & Width` to partially remove outline or adjust the thickness.
- Shadows are weak in bright places.  
  → `Environment Strength` value affects the strength of shadows in bright places.
